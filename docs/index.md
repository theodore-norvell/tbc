Take Back Control. Event-driven programming without inversion of control. Especially for GUIs and web-development.

This is a process-algebra-inspired and monadic approach to event driven programming. The idea is to replace ad-hoc approaches
and state-based approaches with an approach that is more like good old sequential (and parallel) programming. It can be used 
for designing the control aspect of graphical user interfaces and asynchronous communication with a server.

The implementation is in Haxe, but the intention is to export a library that can be used directly from JavaScript and perhaps
other languages.
