Take Back Control. Event-driven programming without inversion of control.

This is a process-algebra-inspired and monadic approach to event driven programming and parallel programming.

The idea is to replace ad-hoc approaches
and state-based approaches with an approach that is more like good old sequential (and parallel) programming. It can be used 
for designing the control aspect of graphical user interfaces and asynchronous communication with a server.

The implementation is in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), but the library can also be used from JavaScript, TypeScript, and some of Haxe's other target language.
